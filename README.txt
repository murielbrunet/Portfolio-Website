Muriel Brunet
Final Project
Visual Storytelling
Fall 2016

When I set out to make this project, my greatest hope was to create a memorable portfolio 
that I could potentially send to employers or grad schools. In some ways, I am very happy
with how it turned out but I also learned that making a full website is a very time
consuming and complex project. I spent the majority of my time working on how the website
would look and operate rather than what would be housed within it. So, this is to say that
this will be an ongoing project for me, one that will require continued thought and 
engagement with my past work in order to create something with meaning. I hope others will 
see and explore this portfolio and get a deeper and fuller understanding of what I've done 
in the past, what interests me, and what I hope to accomplish in the future.

In the future, I'd like to create fuller stories through detailed descriptions of my
pieces. I also hope to eventually translate my website into French and Japanese.

Please note that the send button on the Contact page has not yet been activated. Also, I
initially designed this website on my small computer screen, so if things start looking
weird on your monitor, thatâ€™s why. I hope to learn responsive web design over J-term and
fix that!
